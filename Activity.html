        Let me dive into your ocean of emotions
        Let me crawl into your senses, love
        Give you truth and my devotion, slow motion
        Feel your body as I lay you down
    </p>
        
    <p>
        'Cause I won't really mind
        If you're gonna take all my clothes off, nee-nah-nah
        To feel loved
        Last piece of my life puzzle, you should know that I need ya
        So, move your body close to mine
    </p>

    <p>
        You've been talking to the last guy, uh
        He's been asking you one last time
        If he could try to mend and fix your broken heart, uh
        Read back pages that you've torn apart
    </p>

    <p>
        But all he gave you was destruction, desolation
        He just believes in satisfaction, oh, oh
        He cut your heart and left it open, now you're all in
        And I don't want you as an option, girl, no
    </p>

    <p>
        Let me dive into your ocean of emotions
        Let me crawl into your senses, love
        Give you truth and my devotion, slow motion
        Feel your body as I lay you down
    </p>

    <p>
        'Cause I won't really mind
        If you're gonna take all my clothes off, nee-nah-nah
        To feel loved
        Last piece of my life puzzle, you should know that I need ya
        So, move your body close to mine
    </p>

    <p>
        I was lying to myself lately
        Denying the truth of how you just make me feel
        I'm in here sitting, drinking whiskey at the corner
        Waiting for you to come around and be my lover
    </p>

    <p>
        Give me warmth, and I will let you ignite
        We'll walk the streets on fire and fill it with lights
        No, I don't want to be pretentious, you're a goddess
        I sound a little bit ridiculous, but I'm honest
    </p>

    <p>
        Let me dive into your ocean of emotions
        Let me crawl into your senses, love
        Give you truth and my devotion, slow motion
        Feel your body as I lay you down
    </p>

    <p>
        'Cause I won't really mind
        If you're gonna take all my clothes off, nee-nah-nah
        To feel loved
        Last piece of my life puzzle, you should know that, nee-nah-nah
        So, move your body close to mine, oh, oh-oh
    </p>

    <p>
        Nee-nah-nah (nee-nah-nah)
        To feel loved
        Nee-nah-nah (nee-nah-nah)
        To feel loved
        Nee-nah-nah (nee-nah-nah)
        To feel loved
        Nee-nah-nah (nee-nah-nah)
        So, move your body close to mine
